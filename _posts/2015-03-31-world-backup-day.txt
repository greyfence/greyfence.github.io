I'm celebrating!  Are you?   Someone should backup the party.  I'd do it, but I'm kind of busy.  Maybe I'll get to it later.  Hopefully it won't crash and I'd lose it all.
 
With so much of our lives being digital (documents, pictures, emails), everyone has experienced losing some bit of it from time to time.  

 [ World Backup Day ](http://www.worldbackupday.com/en/) has been created as a way to remind people that it's important to preserve at least one copy of those precious files off the computer or camera or phone in case the worst happens.

The website has the statistic that up to 30% of us have **never** made a backup.  That's just all kinds of sad waiting to happen.


In observation of Word Backup Day, Tech Republic has a [ detailed post ](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/world-backup-day-best-practices-to-backup-your-data/)  about the importance of backing up and include the 3-2-1 rule.

> This is why the introduction of the 3-2-1 rule for data backups makes logical sense for the real world, as it introduces flexibility. The 3-2-1 rule posits that there should be at least 3 copies of data that are stored on at least 2 different media, and at least 1 of the copies must be stored offsite

As the World Backup Day folks say:  Don't be an April Fool.  Backup your data.
